1. Wire up the BluRay.
 
2. Build the disc at least once.
This will make all the tmp media. Look in <project>/Sources/Menus/ and you will see the m2v file used for the background. This is the file we want to replace.
 
3. Save and close Encore.
 
4. Copy (don't move) the x264 stream to the Sources/Menus folder.
 
5. Open <project>/ProjectMedia.acx and search for the m2v file. Rename the x264 stream to match that of the m2v file. Do not change the file extension.
 
6. Edit following PhysicalMedia data
a. 'file' to point to the m4v file, e.g. "../Sources/Menus/MENU.264"
b. 'size' to match the new m4v file size in bytes, obtained from Get Info on the x264 stream, e.g. 112.8 mb file is "112776228"
c. 'codec' to be "H.264".
 
7. Save the file.

8. Manually delete the <project>/AuthorScriptHDMVSessions dir
 
9. Reopen the project and rebuild the disc. Fingers crossed it should now use the h.264 file.
 

I have noticed that Encode likes to randomly delete and change it's mind about cached files. So be aware that the edits you make may revert back with little to no warning.
